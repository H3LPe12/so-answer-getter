Dependencies can be found in the dependencies folder located in the root.

I've hardcoded the database string in /Models/AnswerGuesserContext.cs

Not the best idea I know, but this is a quick app.

In order to start your EntityFrameworkCore database.  Simply run: 
Update-Database ForScience

In the Package Management Console.

It's a relatively simple app and my first go in AngularJS.

Thanks.
